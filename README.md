- **Business Problem:** Netflix wants to gather useful insights on their shows and movies for their subscribers through their datasets. The issue is, they are working with too much data (approximately 82k rows of data combined) and are unsure how to effectively analyze and extract meaningful insights from it. They need a robust and scalable data analytics solution to handle the vast amount of data and uncover valuable patterns and trends.

- **How I Plan On Solving the Problem:** In helping Netflix gather valuable insights from their extensive movies and shows dataset, I will be utilizing SQL and a data visualization tool like Tableau to extract relevant information, and conduct insightful analyses. By leveraging SQL's functions, I can uncover key metrics such as viewer ratings, popularity trends, genre preferences, and viewership patterns. Once the data has been extracted and prepared, I will leverage Tableau to present the findings. This will allow for interactive exploration of the data, enabling stakeholders at Netflix to gain actionable insights through visually appealing charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations. I plan on creating a dynamic dashboard in Tableau that enables users to delve into specific movie genres, viewer demographics, or geographical regions.



## Conclusion 
By exploring various aspects of the dataset, a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's content landscape was gained. The analysis revealed the top 10 and bottom 10 movies and shows based on their IMDB scores, which highlighted the titles that garnered high praise and those that received lower ratings. This information can assist viewers in making informed choices and highlight areas for potential improvement in content quality. The examination of movies and shows distributed across different decades showed significant shifts in content availability over time. Notably, the dataset showcased a substantial increase in offerings from the 2000s onwards, emphasizing Netflix's commitment to featuring newer content that resonates with current trends and audience preferences.

Age certifications played a crucial role in the dataset, impacting both the average IMDB scores and the distribution of movies and shows. The analysis revealed audience preferences for specific age certifications, with TV-14 garnering the highest average score, suggesting its high popularity among viewers. Furthermore, the different age certifications also showed the diverse range of content available on Netflix. Finally, the exploration of the most common genres in Netflix's library provided insights into viewer preferences and content distribution. Comedy emerged as the dominant genre across both movies and shows, followed by documentation and drama. Combinations of genres were also frequent, highlighting the audience's appreciation for multi-genre content.
